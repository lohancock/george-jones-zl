About making Celestia videos that show the sky position of Earth rings 
for the times and places of George Jones's zodiacal light observations of 1853 and years following.  
George Jones said that his observations were inconsistent with the ZL accounts of Cassini and Laplace, 
and that they better fit the hypothesis of an Earth ring near the plane of the ecliptic.  
Here we try out an Earth ring in the plane of the lunar orbit, about five degrees from the ecliptic.
